abstract = {Abstract This paper presents a review of state-of-the-art solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC), from perspective of dynamic modeling and model-based control. First, the current status of SOFC development is provided. Then the main components of the SOFC along with their governing transport equations are discussed. These two sections provide basic introduction to the SOFC. Following the sequence of power generation and energy losses mechanism of SOFC, the section of dynamic modeling is started from overview of energy generation, followed by discussion of energy losses, and concluded by analyzing the dynamics that affect energy generation and losses. The section of dynamic modeling is closed by considering the model validation problem and other related problems in the modeling aspect. Once dynamic models are available, the paper continues its journey to the SOFC control problems. It is started from a general description of the control problems in SOFC, continued with an overview of the existing control strategies, and followed by a sample nonlinear MPC solution. This section is concluded by discussion of some of the challenges in SOFC control problems.},

abstract = {Hydrogen (H2) is a clean fuel that can be produced from various resources including biomass. Optimization of H2 production from catalytic steam reforming of toluene using response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial neural network coupled genetic algorithm (ANN-GA) models has been investigated. In RSM model, the central composite design (CCD) is employed in the experimental design. The CCD conditions are temperature (500–900 °C), feed flow rate (0.006–0.034 ml/min), catalyst weight (0.1–0.5 g) and steam-to-carbon molar ratio (1–9). ANN model employs a three-layered feed-forward backpropagation neural network in conjugation with the tangent sigmoid (tansig) and linear (purelin) as the transfer functions and Levenberg-Marquardt training algorithm. Best network structure of 4-14-1 is developed and utilized in the GA optimization for determining the optimum conditions. An optimum H2 yield of 92.6{\%} and 81.4{\%} with 1.19{\%} and 6.02{\%} prediction error are obtained from ANN-GA and RSM models, respectively. The predictive capabilities of the two models are evaluated by statistical parameters, including the coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE). Higher R2 and lower RSME values are reported for ANN-GA model (R2 = 0.95, RMSE = 4.09) demonstrating the superiority of ANN-GA in determining the nonlinear behavior compared to RSM model (R2 = 0.87, RMSE = 6.92). These results infer that ANN-GA is a more reliable and robust predictive steam reforming modelling tool for H2 production optimization compared to RSM model.},

@article{Montero-Sousa2020,
abstract = {Energy storage is one of the challenges of the electric sector. There are several different technologies available for facing it, from the traditional ones to the most advanced. With the current trend, it is mandatory to develop new energy storage systems that allow optimal efficiency, something that does not happen with traditional ones. Another feature that new systems must meet is to envisage the behaviour of energy generation and consumption. With this aim, the present research deals the hydrogen consumption prediction of a fuel cell based system thanks a hybrid intelligent approach implementation. The work is based on a real testing plant. Two steps have been followed to create a hybrid model. First, the real dataset has been divided into groups whose elements have similar characteristics. The second step, carry out the regression using different techniques. Very satisfactory results have been achieved during the validation of the model.},
